            <h2 id="server-advertisements">⮞ Server Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Promoting other Minecraft servers on our server is not allowed. When players advertise other servers, it can disrupt the community and lead to fragmentation.

            <h2 id="security-risk">⮞ Security Risk</h2>
            <p>Protecting the safety and security of our server and its players is a top priority. Posting malicious links, such as those leading to viruses, phishing sites, or other harmful content, is strictly forbidden. These actions can compromise the security of players' personal information and devices. Always be cautious about clicking on links, and ensure that anything you share is safe and trustworthy. <br><br>This punishment may also be used when players are too unruly for our community and so can be permanently removed from all platforms.</p>
            <ul>

            <h2 id="encouraging-misuse">⮞ Encouraging Misuse</h2>
            <p>Encouraging others to break server rules or misuse features undermines the integrity of our community. Whether it’s telling someone to exploit a bug or suggesting they spam the chat, promoting rule-breaking behaviour is not allowed.</p>

            <h2 id="ddos-threats">⮞ DDOS Threats</h2>

                <li>Violation #1 - Perm Ban</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="griefing">⮞ Griefing</h2>
            <p>Griefing is the act of intentionally destroying, altering, or otherwise damaging another player’s structures or items without permission. This can ruin the enjoyment of the game for other players by destroying their hard work and investments. Our server aims to foster a cooperative and friendly community where players can build and explore without fear of their creations being vandalized.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - 1d Ban</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="tp-trapping">⮞ TP Trapping</h2>
            <p>TP trapping involves using the teleportation (TP) function to lure players into traps, leading to the potential loss of items or lives. This practice disrupts fair play and trust among players. Please ensure you only TP to players you can trust and record in case you aren't sure so that you can help staff. Do not set up any type of trapping devices that can lure players into being teleported and stuck, harmed, or killed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - 1d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - 3d Ban</li>

            <h2 id="claim-disruption">⮞ Claim Disruption</h2>
            <p>Claim Disruption involves claiming areas of someone else's claim to be an annoyance, attempting to block their claim by claiming directly around it, or attempting to use another player's claim to cause disruption (for example, sitting on their claim to steal items or get in the way of them attempting to play and enjoy the server).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - 1d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - 3d Ban</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="scamming">⮞ Scamming</h2>
            <p>Scamming involves deceiving other players to steal items, currency, or services through false promises or trades. This undermines the trust and integrity of the server’s economy and player interactions. All trades and agreements between players should be conducted honestly and fairly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - 3d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - 7d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #3 - 30d Ban</li>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="unfair-advantage">⮞ Unfair Advantage</h2>
            <p>Unfair advantage refers to the use of hacks, mods, or any third-party software that gives players an unfair advantage over others. Using hacks, mods, or other tools to gain an unfair advantage disrupts the balance of the game and can significantly impact other players' experiences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - 7d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - 30d Ban</li>
                <li>Violation #3 - Perm Ban</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="abusing-exploits">⮞ Abusing Exploits</h2>
            <p>Abusing exploits involves the use of in-game bugs or glitches to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt gameplay. Exploits can range from duplication glitches to bugs that allow players to bypass game mechanics. While discovering a bug is sometimes inevitable, intentionally abusing it to benefit oneself or disrupt the game for others is not acceptable. Players are encouraged to report exploits rather than abuse them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - Perm Ban</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="mute-evasion">⮞ Mute Evasion</h2>
            <p>Mute evasion involves attempting to bypass a mute issued by server staff by using alternate accounts or other means. We ask that if you disagree with a punishment, you make a ticket to appeal it rather than attempting to evade it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - Mimics the timeframe of the main account's punishment</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - Perm Mute</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="ban-evasion">⮞ Ban Evasion</h2>
            <p>Ban evasion refers to creating new accounts or using other methods to bypass a ban issued by server staff. We ask that you make a ticket to appeal a punishment rather than attempting to evade it if you disagree with it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation #1 - Mimics the timeframe of the main account's punishment</li>
                <li>Violation #2 - Perm Ban</li>
