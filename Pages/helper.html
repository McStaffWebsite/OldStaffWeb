            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the staff team! When you first get your rank ingame you might notice that all the staff are talking in a private chat. To do so you have to use the <a href="/Pages/commands.html#sc" id="desclink">/sc</a> command. It will send a message only staff can read</p>

            <h2>Advice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Scroll thru the #denied-punishments channel to understand the line between what we punish and we dont punish. This is very useful if you're unsure of spam or inapp language offences.</li>
                <li>Engage in community as often as possible. Building trust between you and the playerbase improves you as a staff member.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>For the time being helpers <b>cannot mute for longer than 1 Day</b> so if the punishment requires longer you have to go to #staff-support and put all information there.</p>
