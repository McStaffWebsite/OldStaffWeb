            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>As a moderator you have more responsabilities than a helper. You have now access to see automod notifications in chat about xray and chat offences.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Permissions</h2>
            <p>After you become moderator you gain access to a lot more commands such as:</p>

            <div id="perms">
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#warn">/warn</a>
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#mute">/mute</a>
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#ban">/ban</a>
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#history">/history</a>
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#vanish">/vanish</a>
                <a href="/Pages/commands.html#tp">/tp</a>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Advice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Scroll thru the #denied-punishments channel to understand the line between what we punish and we dont punish. This is very useful if you're unsure of spam or inapp language offences.</li>
                <li>Engage in community as often as possible. Building trust between you and the playerbase improves you as a staff member.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>For the time being helpers <b>cannot mute for longer than 1 Day</b> so if the punishment requires longer you have to go to #staff-support and put all information there.</p>
